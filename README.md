# Notedown

**Notedown** is a little build system to generate nicely formatted computing talk notes. 
You can comfortably compose the notes in Markdown, and Notedown will wrap it up with some CSS rules to make it more readable.

## Configuration

 * `$TALK` -- Set this to the name of your Markdown file (i.e. `$TALK.md`). It will also be the name of your output (i.e. `$TALK.html`).
 * `$TITLE` -- This is the title of the notes. Watch out: this gets spliced into a `sed` command, so escape any special sequences.
 * `$MDPARSER` -- The command to parse the Markdown file. Include all needed flags such that the next token should be the Markdown filename.

## Formatting

There are two kinds of code blocks generated by Notedown. 
Dark gray blocks with green text are meant for shell commands and outputs. They are just regular code blocks in Markdown. 
White blocks with black text are meant for showing the contents of files. They are code blocks inside blockquotes.

    This is regular text.
        $: this_is_a_shell_command
    >   This is text in a file.
